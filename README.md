Successfully refactored and "cleaned" the given jlock
code, save <i>lock.py</i> and <i>unlock.py</i>. Added
docstrings to all modules and functions and slightly
modified UI on certain error handling. <br><br>
Added automated tests to test the sturdiness of certain
utility functions, all passed.<br><br>
To get things started, type:<br><b> $ python3 jlock.py -h
</b>
